----------------------------
Running Instructions:
Put all files in the same directory. To find SVP, run "Make all". Then,
run "./runme" followed by your basis vectors in square brackets seperated
by spaces, for example "./runme [1 2] [2 2]". The result will be saved
in a result.txt file. To do another calculation, run "./runme" with a 
different basis or to get rid of the .o output files, run "Make clean."
